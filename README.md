# Hyper IDE

Hyper IDE is a web based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that supports more than 100 programming 
languages out of the box. It does not feature any project files or structure, and does not plan on ever 
getting one, but rather allows you to browse all your files, on your web server, and edit these as you 
see fit, and hence works with any projects types, as long as your project files are text files.

Hyper IDE has autocomplete for many languages, including HTML, XML, JavaScript, Hyperlambda, and more,
and also features syntax highlightning. It comes with 57 different themes out of the box, but you
can easily apply your own favourite colors and skin for it, by editing a CSS file with some 15-20 
different selectors.
