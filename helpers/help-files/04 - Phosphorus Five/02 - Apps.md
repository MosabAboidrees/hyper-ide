All of the above apps can be installed through [the Bazar](/bazar), which is also open source, and distributed with Phosphorus Five out of the box.
Notice, the Bazar also allows you to create your own Bazar manifests, pointing to your own apps, allowing for you to setup your own _"App Store"_,
to charge for your own apps, and distribute these to your clients, as you see fit. Below is a screenshot of the Bazar.

By setting up your own Bazar, and creating your own build, using Hyperbuild. You can easily control distribution of apps to your clients, basically
ending up with your own privately held _"App Store"_.

If you [purchase a license](/bazar?app=license) of Phosphorus Five, you get the right to distribute and modify all of the above apps within a proprietary
context, and you can re-brand the apps, modify them, and sell them as _"closed source"_, any ways you see fit to your clients. One exception though, is
that you are not allowed to sell _"developer tools"_ based upon Phosphorus Five. The license grants you full rights, besides re-branding, and/or selling
parts of Phosphorus Five as a _"developer toolbox"_. Read more about the proprietary license [here](https://gaiasoul.com/license). The previous link,
also allows you to purchase a _"Professional Enterprise License"_, if you have extended needs, beyond that which 
a [normal, single developer license](/bazar?app=license) gives you.

If you have even more needs than that which a _"Professional Enterprise License"_ gives you, implying you have dozens of developers, or want to re-sell
Phosphorus Five and the GaiaSoul suite - You can send an email to thomas@gaiasoul.com, and I am sure we can come to an arrangement.
