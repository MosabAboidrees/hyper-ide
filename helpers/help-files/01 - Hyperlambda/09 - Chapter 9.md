# The bug

This chapter discuss some of the philosophical and psychological implications of learning Hyperlambda. The chapter is not necessary to read, if you only want to learn Hyperlambda and P5. However, I believe in that the more broad your knowledge about anything becomes, the better suited you are to learn something very narrow. If you don't want to read about my philosophical reasons for designing Hyperlambda the way I did, feel free to skip to the [next chapter](chapter-10.md).

**True story**

> In the 1950s, an American car manufacturer wanted to offshore the creation of some parts of their cars to a Japanese sub contractor. They were naturally very concerned, although the math had shown them, that they were going to save a lot of money in this process. So they wrote an extremely detailed specification, covering all aspects of their specification to the sub contractor. This way, they believed that it would be impossible for the sub contractor to do anything wrong.
> 
> As a part of their specification, they had written down the maximum amount of fault tolerance to the Japanese sub contracter, being some small percentage, which they expected to go wrong, and could tolerate as a fault margin. After a couple of months, a ship comes to America, with all the parts from Japan. There was one big package and one smaller package next to it. In addition, there was a letter of explanation next to the deliverance. The American car manufacturer couldn't understand why there was two packages, and scratched their heads, until they read the letter that was delivered together with the shipments.
> 
> "Although we do not understand why you would want some pieces to not function correctly, we have delivered these malfunctioning parts in the small box next to the parts that are working."

If you don't find the above letter funny, you don't know much about Japanese culture. If you find any bugs in this book, please [let me know](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive-dox/issues). This chapter should contain the only bug in the book, in accordance to Japanese Zen philosophy. Below is the bug.
