## Introduction

Welcome to the _"book"_ about Hyperlambda. In this interactive _"book"_, we will go through Hyperlambda examples, 
allowing you to instantly play with them, from within your IDE. This _"book"_ is created in an interactive way, 
allowing you to instantly play with the examples, by interacting with the documentation itself. I refer to 
this as _"literate documentation"_, implying that the documentation itself, understands, and can execute, the 
same type of computer code, it is intended to document.

This book is not _"read only"_. In fact, you can edit this page if you want to, by scrolling to the bottom of 
this page, and clicking the _"pencil"_ button in the bottom right corner of the page. This will open up this 
file in Hyper IDE, allowing for you to edit it, and add your own personal notes, as you proceed through the book. 
When you are done editing some parts of the book, you can click the _"refresh"_ button, to reload the page, into 
the _"reader"_. This _"book"_ will also sometimes contain inline YouTube videos and images.

### Goals of the book

By reading this book, you will learn everything you need to know to create your first Hyperlambda application - From the first 
line of code, to deployment in a production environment. My goal is to bring you up to this knowledge in Hyperlambda, 
in roughly 2 days. That way, the book becomes very practical, and hands on, progressing rapidly, and you can feel that 
you have done something constructive fast. We will start out by creating smaller examples, and proceed to more rich
examples, providing the foundation for you to solve your own problems.

The second goal of the book, is to give you all the knowledge necessary to modify, create, and maintain Hyper IDE itself,
from which you are probably reading this book. This allows you to customise Hyper IDE, by creating plugins to it, and
in other ways extending it, to fit your own needs. So even if you never intend to create as much as a single application
in Hyperlambda, you will still benefit from reading this book, since it allows you to customise Hyper IDE according to
your needs.

## A guide to the guide

The book's convention, is created carefully to allow you to understand what is being described. First of all, 
any property or attribute from Hyperlambda is referenced like **[foo]**, where *"foo"* assumes we are talking about
a node's name. This convention is used whenever a node is referenced inline in the text. Emphasized and important points, 
are written like *this*. Inline code is written like `this` and multiple lines of code is written like the following.

```hyperlambda
howdy-world
  this-is:A piece of Hyperlambda code!
```
