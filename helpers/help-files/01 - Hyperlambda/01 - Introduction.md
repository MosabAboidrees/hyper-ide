## Introduction

Welcome to the _"book"_ about Phosphorus Five's Hyperlambda. In this interactive
_"book"_, we will go through Hyperlambda examples, allowing you to instantly play with them, from within your IDE. The 
documentation system is created in an interactive way, allowing for you to instantly play with the examples, by interacting
with the documentation itself. I refer to this as _"literate documentation"_, implying that the documentation itself,
understands, and can execute, the same type of computer code, it is intended to document.

In addition, this book is not _"read only"_. In fact, you can edit this very page, as you see fit, by scrolling to the bottom 
of this page, and clicking the _"pencil"_ button in the bottom right corner of the page. This will open up this file, which 
is written in Markdown, in Hyper IDE itself, allowing for you to edit it, and add your own personal notes, as you proceed 
through the book. When you are done editing some parts of the book, you can click the _"refresh"_ button, to reload the page,
into the reader. The _"book"_ will also sometimes contain inline YouTube videos, and images, such as the video below
is a demonstration of.

### Goals of the book

During this book, you will learn everything you need to know to create your first Hyperlambda application - From the first 
line of code, to deployment in a production environment. My goal is to bring you up to this knowledge in Hyperlambda, 
in roughly 2 days. That way, the book becomes very practical, and hands on, progressing rapidly, and you can feel that 
you have done something constructive fast. We will start out with creating smaller systems, and finish up with creating 
a complete, complex, and rich web application.

Every construct we go through, will have a practical application for you. The book is a hands on guide, intended to ignite 
your own creative processes. As we create these practical solutions, we will also discuss the software architecture 
theory behind our choices. After reading this book, you can consider yourself a senior software architect, easily 
capable of discussing software architecture, with some of the best architects on the planet.

The second goal of the book, is to give you all the knowledge necessary to modify, create, and maintain Hyper IDE itself,
from which you are probably reading this book. This allows you to customise Hyper IDE, exactly as you want, and create
plugins for it, as you wish. After having read this book, you will be armed with all the required knowledge, to create
plugins, new template projects, and everything you need in order to customise Hyper IDE as you see fit. If you question
yourself in regards to this pursuit, and the applicability of Hyperlambda, realise the following, which serves as a 
testimonial to Hyperlambda's power.

## Prerequisites for reading

This book assumes some basic knowledge about HTML, but does not require you to know JavaScript and/or C# from before. 
However, some basic knowledge of JavaScript and C#, might be beneficial, since we will dive into these technologies 
in some of the chapters. You can still perfectly take advantage of the book, even if you have never created as much as a 
single line of code in neither JavaScript, C#, nor any other programming languages. This book does not assume you're 
a programmer from before, although it sometimes helps having done some programming earlier. Some basic CSS knowledge 
is also beneficial, however not required.

## Technologies visited

The main programming language in Phosphorus Five is called *"Hyperlambda"*, and will be the programming language used for almost 
all of our examples. Even if you have no interest in learning Hyperlambda, the book will still be valuable for you, 
since it is also a guide to software architecture theory in general. In addition, Hyperlambda is easily extended 
through C#, so a C# developer will also benefit from reading this book.

We will also touch upon HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and some general programming theory throughout this book. However, 
most of the book, is dedicated to hands on, practical examples, of actual useful applications, you could probably 
benefit from having access to, regardless of whether or not you read the book or not.

## A guide to the guide

The book's convention, is created carefully to allow you to understand what is being described. First of all, 
any property or attribute from Hyperlambda is referenced like **[foo]**, where *"foo"* assumes we are talking about
a node's name. This convention is used whenever a node is referenced inline in the text. Emphasized and important points, 
are written like *this*. Inline code is written like `this` and multiple lines of code is written like the following illustrates.
