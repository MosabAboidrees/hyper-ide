## The fastest Hello World tutorial in the world

The easiest way to get started with Hyper IDE, is to select the `/modules/` folder, for then to click
the `+` button in your toolbar, assuming you have enabled the plugin that allows you to create a new module.
Then name your app _"hello-world"_, and select the `hello-world` type. At which point your screen should resemble
the following.

Then simply click the _"Create"_ button, and you're in fact done. If you want to try out your app,
you can [click this link](/hello-world). The above process will create a new module for you, having the following files.

* _"desktop.hl"_ - A _"desktop"_ icon
* _"launch.hl"_ - Your app's launcher file
* _"startup.hl"_ - Your app's startup file
* _"uninstall.hl"_ - Evaluated when your app is uninstalled, through for instance the _"Bazar"_

The app is a Hyperlambda webb app. Hyperlambda is a programming language which is native to Phosphorus Five,
and in fact Hyper IDE is exclusively built in Hyperlambda. Later we will dive deeper into Hyperlambda,
but it basically creates a _"persistent"_ widget hierarchy for you, allowing you
to _"declare"_ your widgets, and their Ajax events. I have written an article about Hyperlambda at MSDN Magazine,
[which you can read here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt809119).
