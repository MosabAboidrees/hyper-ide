## The fastest Hello World tutorial in the world

The easiest way to get started with Hyper IDE, is to select the `/modules/` folder, for then to click
the `+` button in your toolbar, assuming you have enabled the plugin that allows you to create a new module.
Then name your app _"hello-world"_, and select the `hello-world` type. At which point your screen should resemble
the following.

Then simply click the _"Create"_ button, and you're done. If you want to try out your app,
you can [click this link](/hello-world). Your app consists of 5 files, most of which only
serves as a starting ground for your own app.

* _"desktop.hl"_ - A _"desktop"_ icon
* _"launch.hl"_ - Your app's launcher file
* _"startup.hl"_ - Your app's startup file
* _"install.hl"_ - Evaluated when your app is installed, through for instance the _"Bazar"_
* _"uninstall.hl"_ - Evaluated when your app is uninstalled

The app is a _"Hyperlambda"_ web app. Hyperlambda is a programming language which is native to Phosphorus Five.
Hyperlambda is thoroughly documented in other parts of this help system.

### Distributing your app

At this point, you can distribute your app, through the integrated _"Bazar"_ if you wish. The Bazar is
an integrated _"App Store"_ for Phosphorus Five, allowing you to setup your own _"App Store"_, to distribute
your own apps, as you see fit. Later we will dive into exactly how you can do this. If you want to see
the Bazar, you can visit [this link](/bazar).
