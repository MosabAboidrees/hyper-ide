## Column types

There are several different types of columns you can choose to use when creating your fields. Below is a complete
list, and their most important traits explained.

* __Singleline text__ - A single line text type of field
* __Multiline text__ - Multiple lines of text field
* __Checkbox__ - A yes/no type of field
* __Number__ - A way for you to provide a number type of input
* __Select dropdown__ - Allows the user to select from a pre-defined set of different options
* __Radiobuttons__ - Similar to select dropdown, but will display the different options as radiobuttons, where the user must select only one value, from a pre-defined set of values
* __Date/time created__ - Not per se an input field, but an automatically created field, that allows you to track when the item was actually created

Some of the above field types have unique traits, such as for instance the _"Multiline text"_ type of field, which
allows the user to actually provide Markdown, and/or #hash_tags, to easily allow for filtering items, and displaying
content with rich formatting. Below is a screenshot of how an item with both Markdown content, and a hashtag might
appear for you, both during editing, and during viewing the item in the datagrid.

Hashtags allows you to provide integral filtering capacity, as a part pf your item's Multiline content, which
might be useful for categorising your items, and easily later retrieve items according to their multiline text
content. If you click the hashtag in your multiline text content, Camphora Five will filter your items, and
only display items containing that specific hashtag. The syntax for Markdown is really beyond the scope of
this documentation, but you can find several good references on Markdown, such as for
instance [this one](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Markdown is however
a very powerful syntax, and allows you to easily embed images, hyperlinks, and even tables, in addition to
basic formatting, as an integral part of your item's content.

The _"Date/time created"_ field type, is not really an input field, and cannot be changed - But rather serves
to track at what exact date and time your item was created.
