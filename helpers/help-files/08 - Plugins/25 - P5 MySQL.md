
## p5.mysql - MySQL events

This component contains the adapter for MySQL, which allows you to connect to a MySQL database, and select, update,
insert, etc records, the same way you would from e.g. C#. It contains the following public Active Events.

* __[p5.mysql.connect]__
* __[p5.mysql.select]__
* __[p5.mysql.insert]__
* __[p5.mysql.update]__
* __[p5.mysql.delete]__
* __[p5.mysql.execute]__
* __[p5.mysql.scalar]__
* __[p5.mysql.transaction.begin]__
* __[p5.mysql.transaction.rollback]__
* __[p5.mysql.transaction.commit]__
* __[p5.mysql.database.get]__
* __[p5.mysql.database.set]__

Of the above events, the most important one is **[p5.mysql.connect]**. It allows you to connect to a MySQL
database, either by providing the actual connection properties directly, such as
`server=localhost;User Id=root;password=YOUR_MY_SQL_PASSWORD;database=YOUR_DATABASE` - Or by referencing a
named connection string from your web.config, by wrapping its name in square brackets, such as the following
illustrates `[your_database]`.

If you have a named connection string in your web.config, and you wish to select some records from some table,
you could do something like the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mysql.connect:[your_database]
  p5.mysql.select:@"select * from your_table limit 10"
```

The above would return something like the following to you

```hyperlambda
p5.mysql.connect:[your_database]
  p5.mysql.select
    row
      id:uint:17277
      username:root
      word:a
    row
      id:uint:17278
      username:root
      word:abonnement
    row
      id:uint:17279
      username:root
      word:abonnere
[snip]
```

Notice how the invocation to **[p5.mysql.select]** must be wrapped inside your **[p5.mysql.connect]** lambda object.
This is because your connection is determincally closed, when you leave the scope of your **[p5.mysql.connect]**.
The **[p5.mysql.connect]** scope is just a normal plain lambda object, and can contain any Active Event invocations
legally allowed to evaluate outside of its scope.

All MySQL events you want to raise, will have to exist inside of a **[p5.mysql.connect]** invocation - Either
directly, or indirectly.

### [p5.mysql.insert], [p5.mysql.update], [p5.mysql.delete] and [p5.mysql.execute]

The **[p5.mysql.insert]** Active Event will insert a record into your database, and return the ID of the inserted
record as an **[id]** child. The other three events, will not return anything to the caller, besides from the
affected records as the value of your invocation node. Which one you use, is really optional. But I do recommend
to explicitly use the correct event, to make your code more easily understood from a semantic point of view,
according to what your SQL statement actually does.

### [p5.mysql.scalar]

This Active Event will simply execute a scalar SQL statement, such as `select count(*) from some_table`, and
returns the result.

### [p5.mysql.transaction.xxx]

These three events allows you to create a database transaction, which if an exception occurs from within,
will automatically rollback the entire job. This is a nifty feature to make sure either everything is
successfully executed, or nothing is executed at all. An example of usage is given below.

```hyperlambda
p5.mysql.connect:[your_database]
  p5.mysql.transaction.begin
    // Do some SQL insertions, updates and deletions here.
    // If an exception occurs, your database is rolled back, and stays unchanged.

    // Then as your last piece of code, invoke the following
    p5.mysql.transaction.commit
```

Unless the last line in the above code is raised, nothing will change in your database, and your entire
batch will be rolled back. You can of course explicitly rollback a transaction, using
**[p5.mysql.transaction.rollback]** - But this is rarely needed, since it's the default behaviour, and done
automatically if an exception is raised, that makes you leave the scope of your **[p5.mysql.transaction.begin]**
lambda object, without havin explicitly invoked **[p5.mysql.transaction.commit]**.

In fact, you should probably rarely, if ever, explicitly invoke the **[p5.mysql.transaction.rollback]** yourself,
but rather resort to raising an exception, if something goes wrong inside of your transaction lambda object.

### Changing and retrieving your database

The **[p5.mysql.database.get]** and **[p5.mysql.database.set]** Active Events, simply allows you to get and set
the currently active database.

### Best practices

You should probably not supply the database connection string directly into your code, but rather rely on a
web.config setting, and reference it using the square bracket notation demonstrated above. If you do, the
correct way to create a MySQL connection string in your web.config, is as follows.

```xml
  <connectionStrings>
    <add
      name="your_database"
      connectionString="server=localhost;User Id=root;password=YOUR_PASSWORD;database=YOUR_DATABASE"
      providerName="MySql.Data.MySqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
```

Stuff the above settings into your web.config, somewhere for instance above your `<system.web>` parts.
Then reference the connection string indirectly from your code as the following illustrates.

```hyperlambda
p5.mysql.connect:[your_database]
```
