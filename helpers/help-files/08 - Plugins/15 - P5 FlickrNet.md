This folder contains an Active Event that allows you to search for images on Flickr. Its name is
**[p5.flickr.search]**. To use it, you could do something like the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.flickr.search
  api-key:YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY
  text:foo bar
```

The return value, will resemble something like this.

```hyperlambda

[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/).

**Warning**, this module might become obsolete in the future, since it was created at a point in time when
Phosphorus Five did not have a very strong network API itself, and needed to use C# to implement search towards
Flickr, which was needed in a project I was implementing for a client of mine. Today replacing this module,
with custom logic written in Hyperlambda, using e.g. **[p5.http.get]** or **[p5.http.post]** would
probably be quite easy. This module should be considered _"legacy code"_, and should not be used in new projects,
unless you understand the consequences.
