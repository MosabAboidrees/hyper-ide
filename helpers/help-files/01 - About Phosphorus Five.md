Phosphorus Five is a web operating system, and a web application development framework, with some pretty
unique USPs. Among other things, it's extremely dynamic in nature, allowing for orchestrating your application
building blocks together, almost the same way you would assemble LEGO bricks into creations.
Phosphorus Five is a highly modularized, dynamic and flexible, web operating system, created as a thin layer
on top of your existing web server and underlaying operating system.

Phosphorus Five is built around three axioms, which you can read three MSDN Magazine articles about at the following URLs.

* [Active Events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt795187), providing a functional alternative to OOP, where polymorphism and encapsulation is being performed at the _"function level"_ instead of at the class level
* [Hyperlambda](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt809119), which is a natural consequence of Active Events
* [Managed Ajax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt826343), providing an automatic bridge between your server side Hyperlambda and your client side JavaScript

The above three USPs provides an extremely flexible application abstraction layer, on top of the .Net Framework/CLR
or C#, allowing for you to create web apps much faster than what you'd achieve using conventional techniques.
Phosphorus Five is particularly well suited for _"enterprise types of web apps"_, managing data, using web forms
and similar tyopes of techniques - And probably not that well suited for apps that are intended to be massively
scalable, such as social media platforms, required to responding to millions of web requests each day.

Phosphorus Five contains a whole range of apps, which we refer to as the _"GaiaSoul Suite"_, that allows you
to rapidly create your web apps, one way or another. Some examples of such apps are given below.

* Hyper IDE - A web based Integrated Development Environment
* Hypereval - A _"snippet database"_, allowing for you to easily create snippets of Hyperlambda, stored in your MySQL database
* Camphora Five - A CRUD app generator, allowing you to create CRUD apps, literally in seconds
