All other Phosphorus Five modules, distributed through for instance the Bazar, are the sole copyright of 
Thomas Hansen - And unless explicitly granted through an individually named _"proprietary enabling license"_, 
all Phosphorus Five components and modules are distributed under the terms of the GPL license version 3, 
as published by the Free Software Foundation. See the [Free Software Foundation website](https://www.fsf.org/) for details.

See the above respective Open Source projects for licensing information, but in general they are all _"permissive"_ in nature,
except iTextSharp, which is distributed under an Affero GPL license. Which implies that if you use the PDF
featured of Posphorus Five, you'll have to explicitly link to the parts of your source code in your application
that is using iTextSharp, or purchase a proprietary enabling license from the publishers of iTextSharp. If 
this is a problem, then simply **avoid using the PDF features in Phosphorus Five**, and you should be safe.

In addition, I would like to say a special thank you to the following people and organisations.

* My three diamonds, you know who you are
* Jeffrey Steadfast for giving me excellent support and help when ever I got stuck in MimeKit or MailKit
* Svein Daniel Solvenus for providing feedback in the early stages of the project
* Michael Desmond and James McCaffrey for allowing me to write three articles at MSDN Magazine
* The Mono project for making my work possible
* All my friends for literally keeping me alive, during this project, when I could not even afford to buy food, or pay my own rent, and for believing in me, when nobody else would
* And last but not least, my beautiful and amazing _"wife"_ and partner, Lisbeth Aardal, for supporting me in a time of my life, when the word utter despair, was a much too soft of a description, for describing my status
