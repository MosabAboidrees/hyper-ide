## Your first real application

In this chapter, we will create a contacts application, allowing us to keep track of our friends, their emails, and phone numbers. Before 
we can dive into our application though, there are some concepts we'll need to cover first.

* Loading and saving of files
* Parts of the folder structure of Phosphorus Five
* The **[apply]** Active Event
* Widget lambda events

### Loading and saving files

In P5, there are two important events for loading and saving files. These are **[load-file]** and **[save-file]**. Before we start using 
them though, we'll need to have a look at the folder structure of P5.

The most important folder for this chapter is called *"users"*. This folder will contain one folder for each user you have in your P5 installation. 
By default, P5 has only one user, which is your *"root"* user - So typically as you start out with P5, there will only be one folder here. This 
folder will be the *"root"* folder. You can browse this folder using your folder explorer in Hyper IDE. Below is a screenshot of how this
folder looks like in my installation.

https://phosphorusfive.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/users-folder-screenshot.png

Inside of your user's folder, the *"root"* folder that is, you can find a *"documents"* folder. This is the equivalent of *"Your documents"* 
in windows, or *"Home"* in Linux. This is important to understand for this chapter, since we will store our *"database"* within this folder. 
Our file will be named *"adr.hl"*. The extension *".hl"* implies *"[H]yper - [L]ambda"*. Your *"documents"* folder, contains two folders. 
One *"private"* folder, and another *"public"* folder. We will be using the *"private"* folder, to store a file, containing the data for our 
CRUD application. Files inside of this folder, cannot in general, be accessed by anyone, except the user whom these files belongs to. 
Hence, they are your user's *"private files"*.

To reference files inside of your user's home folder, you can prepend your path with a tilde `~/`. If you start out a filename with a tilde, 
this will automatically refer to a file in your user's home folder. If you want to create a file inside of your private documents folder, 
you can use something resembling the following code.

```hyperlambda
save-file:~/documents/private/foo.txt
  src:Hello filesystem!
```

If you execute the above code in Hypereval, it will create a simple text file for you, inside of your private documents folder. To understand 
why, realize that the tilde `~` will be substituted with *"/users/username"*, before the file is saved. The *"username"* parts of the path, 
depends upon which user is logged in, invoking the **[save-file]** event. Since the root folder for *everything* related to files in P5, 
is the main root web application folder, this means your file can be found within *"/phosphorusfive/core/p5.webapp/users/root/documents/private/"* - 
Where ever that is locally within your system. Notice, this assumes you're using the source code version of Phosphorus Five. If you have 
deployed your system into a Linux production environment, typically the file will end up somewhere inside 
of _"/var/www/html/users/root/documents/private/"_ somewhere.

### The [apply] event

The **[apply]** Active event, is kind of like the *"Superman version"* of **[add]**. It allows you to take a data source, and combine it 
with a template, to create an entire hierarchy of nodes, and append into some destination, applying your template for each **[src]** result 
node set. We will be using this Active Event, to dynamically create an HTML table, from the content of your data file, containing the *"database"* 
for your contacts.

It might help to visualize the **[apply]** event as *"braiding"* together a data source and a template, to produce a combined results. If you 
find this concept difficult to understand, then don't despair, since there's a video at the end of this chapter, explaining it in details.

### Widget lambda events

As vaguely touched upon in one of our previous chapters, a widget can associate Active Events with itself. These are *"local"* events, 
that only exists, for as long as the widget itself exists. We will create one widget lambda event like this, to *"databind"* our HTML table.
We will create this event with the name of **[examples.databind-addresses]**. This event can be invoked just like a normal Active Event. 
If we wanted to, we could also pass in arguments, and return arguments from it, just as if it was a normal event. We do not need to neither 
pass in, nor return any arguments from it though. We simply need to *"databind"* our HTML table element within it. Which we will do, 
by loading our database file, and create an HTML table widget, for each **[item]** in our file.

### The code for our application

With these concepts, at least partially covered, let's move on to the code, and show you the entire listing for an Address book web app. 
Modify our _"Hello World"_ app's _"launch.hl"_ file from one of the first chapters, and exchange its code with the code listed below.
Or, simply click the _"lightning"_ button at the bottom of our source listing, to evaluate it inline.

### [apply] in details

As previously mentioned, the **[apply]** Active Event, allows you to braid together a data **[src]**, with a **[template]**, and put the 
results into some destination. The destination is expected to be the value of the main **[apply]** node, and must be an expression leading 
to one or more nodes. The destination must return a node somehow, usually implying it should be type declared as a `?node` type of expression. 
Which you may remember from a previous chapter, was the default type declaration of an expression.

Its **[src]** argument, is expected to be an expression, also leading to a node-set somehow. The way to envision the **[src]** argument, 
is that **[apply]** iterates over its **[src]** result set, and uses the currently iterated node, as the idenity node, for creating a lambda 
object, based upon the **[template]**, where expressions inside of your **[template]** can reference the currently iterated **[src]** node.
The **[template]** hence, is being created once for each result from the **[src]** expression, having every iteration, use the currently 
iterated **[src]** node, as its identity node.

### Databound expressions in [apply]

You can see one of the data bound expressions in your code editor above where it says `{innerValue}:x:/*/name?value`. Such a databound 
expression, is declared by making sure its name starts with a `{`and ending with a `}`. These two parts of your node's name are removed 
though, before the node is created, and appended into its destination. They are simply there to inform **[apply]** that this is a 
databound node. Hence, to declare a databound node, simply wrap its name inside of curly braces, and add up an expression being its relative 
path, to whatever you wish to databind the node's value towards.

The expression in the value of a data bound node, is local for the currently iterated **[src]** result. This means that the *"idenity"* 
node for the first iteration, is in fact not the **[{innerValue}]** node itself, but rather the first item from our **[load-file]** invocation.

### Semantics of [load-file] when loading Hyperlambda files

At this point, it might be useful to realize that our invocation to **[load-file]**, will in fact automatically convert Hyperlambda files 
into a lambda object, unless you explicitly tell it not to. So our **[load-file]**, after invocation, will in fact not yield plain text, 
but in fact an entire lambda hierarchy. It will resemble the following example after evaluation.

```hyperlambda
/* ... rest of code ... */

load-file
  /users/root/documents/private/adr.hl
    item
      name:Thomas Hansen
      email:thomas@gaiasoul.com
      phone:98765432
    item
      name:John Doe
      email:john@doe.com
      phone:99887766

/* ... rest of code ... */
```

So what our **[src]** argument to **[apply]** is actually pointing to, are the **[item]** nodes returned from **[load-file]**. It probably 
helps to lock this mental picture into your mind, and realize that the **[src]** expression to **[apply]** hence, is actually iterating 
over every single **[item]** from your _"database file"_.

This means that when we write `:x:/*/name?value` inside of a databound node, like we do in our first data bound node, this expression is 
for the first iteration of our **[src]** argument, relative to the first **[item]** from the results of our **[load-file]** invocation above. 
For the second iteration, it is relative to the second **[item]**, and so on. So what is added to our **[widget]** hierarchy, becomes 
something similar to the following.

```hyperlambda
container
  element:tr
  widgets
    literal
      element:td
      innerValue:Thomas Hansen
    literal
      element:td
      innerValue:thomas@gaiasoul.com
    literal
      element:td
      innerValue:98765432
container
  element:tr
  widgets
    literal
      element:td
      innerValue:John Doe
    literal
      element:td
      innerValue:john@doe.com
    literal
      element:td
      innerValue:99887766
```

If you find the **[apply]** event to be confusing, you can watch this video, which unfortunately is a little bit old though.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcaRyjj2w58

### [lambda2hyper], converting lambda to Hyperlambda

The above **[lambda2hyper]** Active Event, which we use in our code, simply converts a piece of lambda to a string, resembling 
its Hyperlambda version. There also exists a **[hyper2lambda]** event, which does the opposite. These events are useful for transforming 
lambda objects to Hyperlambda, and vice versa - Such as when we want to save a lambda object to disc, or use it as a string for some reason. 
Both of these two events should be relatively self explaining.

### Our "wizard" window

Our **[micro.widgets.wizard]** invocation is a new construct. Its purpose is simply to provide an easy wrapper for asking the user for some 
new input, or edit some existing data. It allows to declare which input you want to ask the user from, and transforms from e.g. **[text]** to
an _"input"_ element/widget automatically. If you click the *"+"* button in your application, you can clearly see the relationship between 
the **[micro.widgets.wizard]** node's children, and the 3 input textboxes, asking the user for a *"name"*, *"email"* and *"phone"*.

Our wizard widget is documented in the Micro section of our documentation.

The **[micro.form.serialize]** event, does exactly what you think it does. After invocation, it will look something like the following.

```hyperlambda
micro.form.serialize
  name:Thomas Hansen
  email:thomas@gaiasoul.com
  phone:98765432
```

Also our serialize event is documented in our Micro section.

After we have retrieved the values from our wizard window, we first check if there already exists a *"database file"*. This is necessary, 
in order to make sure we actually *add* records to our data. If it does, we load this file, and add the contents of it into a 
temporary **[.content]** node. Notice, we do this before we add the values from our newly created record into this file, to ensure the 
last record supplied, physically becomes the last record in our file. This preserves the order of our records, according to the order 
they were supplied by the user. Then finally, before we convert this **[.content]** node to Hyperlambda, and save it to disc, we add 
the values from our *"wizard"* window.

Our little **[while]** trick, simply ensures we only save our 10 most recent records.

The last thing we do in our **[onclick]** Ajax event, is to make sure we invoke **[examples.databind-addresses]**, which is our widget 
lambda event, that is responsible for databinding our HTML table all over again.
