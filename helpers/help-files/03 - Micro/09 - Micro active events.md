
## Micro Active Events

Micro also contains a whole range of additional Active Events, solving particular tasks in your
daily use of Phosphorus Five. Below is a list of some of the more important ones.

* __[micro.css.add]__ - Adds a CSS class to one or more widgets
* __[micro.css.delete]__ - Deletes a CSS class from one or more widgets
* __[micro.css.toggle]__ - Toggles a CSS class in one or more widgets
* __[micro.css.include]__ - Includes Micro CSS on your page
* __[micro.download.file]__ - Downloads a file to the client
* __[micro.form.serialize]__ - Retrieve all form element values beneath some widget
* __[micro.google.translate]__ - Translates the given text using Google Translate
* __[micro.page.set-focus]__ - Sets the focus to a widget on your page
* __[micro.speech.listen]__ - Listens for input using speech recognition
* __[micro.speech.speak]__ - Speaks the given text
* __[micro.speech.stop]__ - Stops listening and speaking, if active
* __[micro.speech.query-voices]__ - Queries available voices from your client
* __[micro.windows.info]__ - Shows a small information _"bubble window"_

In addition to the above Active Events, you can find some additional Active Events if you look
at Micro's code. However, the above are the ones I consider _"stable"_ at the time of writing.
Be warned!
