## Introduction to Plugins

I still haven't found the time to port the documentation for the plugins to the new help system. However,
you can read the (somewhat dated, and _incomplete_) documentation [online](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive/tree/master/plugins) if you wish.

**Notice**, Phosphorus Five contains plugins for most of your needs. Ranging from zipping/unzipping files,
to creating and sending PGP encrypted emails. There are more than 30 different plugins in Phosphorus Five,
making it a highly modularised Web Operating System. In addition you can easily create your own plugins,
to for instance wrap legacy code, or include custom CLR assemblies you want to consume in Phosphorus Five.
