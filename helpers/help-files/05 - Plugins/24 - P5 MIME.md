
## p5.mime - MIME supporting Active Events

MIME stands for _"Multi-purpose Internet Message Exchange"_, and is usually associated with email. However,
in Phosphorus Five, there exists many other use cases for MIME. Among other things, you can use them as the
basis for web service invocations, from one server to another.

This allows you to use the PGP cryptography features of MIME, when invoking web services, or using MIME for
any other purpose.

### Creating your first MIME message

To create a simple MIME message, you could do something like this.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  text:plain
    content:Foo bar
```

The above code, would result in a single MIME entity, with the _"Content-Type"_ of _"text/plain"_, having the
content of "Foo bar". The MIME entity, will be returned as a **[result]** node of the main invocation node.
Resulting in the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: text/plain

Foo bar"
```

You can create multiple MIME entities at once, by simply adding another child node to **[p5.mime.create]**.
However, this will not result in a multipart, which has to be done by explicitly changing the _"Content-Type"_,
through the main entity node, such as the following is an example of.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed
    text:plain
      content:Some text content
    text:html
      content:<p>Some <strong>HTML</strong> content</p>
```

The above would result in something resembling the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""=-BDZlXJLJY5lTfzoutnnYew==""

--=-BDZlXJLJY5lTfzoutnnYew==
Content-Type: text/plain

Some text content
--=-BDZlXJLJY5lTfzoutnnYew==
Content-Type: text/html

<p>Some <strong>HTML</strong> content</p>
--=-BDZlXJLJY5lTfzoutnnYew==--
"
```

The above code, creates a multipart MIME entity, that contains two text parts, one being a plain text entity,
and the other being an HTML text entity. To understand the structure of the above MIME entity, is beyond the
scope of this document, and if interested, feel free to check out the documentation for the MIME standard(s).

Any node you add up as a child node of your entity, which is not defined as a MIME type (text, image, audio, etc),
will be assumed is a MIME header. For instance, if you wish to have your entire multipart above have the
additional (custom) header of "X-App", and the first text entity have the header of "X-Type", then you could
do something like this.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed
    X-App:P5
    text:plain
      X-Type:Foo bar data
      content:Some text content
    text:html
      content:<p>Some <strong>HTML</strong> content</p>
```

Which would result in the following result.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""=-BoXqtm08oBaCS1a7RYZmBg==""
X-App: P5

--=-BoXqtm08oBaCS1a7RYZmBg==
Content-Type: text/plain
X-Type: Foo bar data

Some text content
--=-BoXqtm08oBaCS1a7RYZmBg==
Content-Type: text/html

<p>Some <strong>HTML</strong> content</p>
--=-BoXqtm08oBaCS1a7RYZmBg==--
"
```

By default, p5.mime supports 9 different MIME media types. These are the different Content-Type values from the
MIME standard, and can each have their own media sub type, according to whatever sub type is legal for the
specific type. The list of media types are as following.

* __[multipart]__ - Used for MIME entities that have children MIME entities
* __[text]__ - Text based MIME entity
* __[image]__ - Images and such
* __[application]__ - Possibly JavaScript and similar types
* __[audio]__
* __[video]__
* __[message]__
* __[example]__
* __[model]__

Check up the MIME standard, to understand exactly what the different types represents, and how to use them.
However, for most uses, understanding the multipart, text, and application types, is probably sufficient.

### Leaf MIME types dissected

Except for the multipart, all of the above MIME types are leaf mime types. This means that they cannot have
children of their own, but are considered to be _"leaf"_ entities of a MIME message tree.

They all share the same set of arguments, which are MIME headers, and you can create any MIME header you wish.
Though, realize, a valid MIME header is defined, as having a name, where it contains at least one UPPERCASE
letter, where every word is separated by a hyphen (-), and each new word in the header's name, starts with
a capital letter. Example given; _"My-Mime-Header"_. Most of the standard MIME headers, are intelligently
understood by the internals of the library, due to the brilliance of the underlaying MimeKit library,
which is used internally by p5.mime.

Notice, instead of providing **[content]** to your leaf entities, you can instead provide a **[filename]**,
which would result in that the content of your leaf entity, would be created from the content of a file,
and not its **[content]** node.

Below is an example of creating a leaf entity from a filename.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  application:X-Hyperlambda
    filename:/system42/application-startup.hl
```

Notice how the above code, would by default create a _"Content-Disposition"_ MIME header for you, putting in
the original filename into its _"filename"_ argument, and making sure the entity is marked as an _"attachment"_.
You can explicitly override this behavior, by creating your own Content-Disposition MIME header. Below is what
the above lambda would result in.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: application/X-Hyperlambda
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=application-startup.hl


... file content ...
"
```

Some of the Active Events in P5, such as the **[p5.smtp.send]** event, from the p5.mail project, will actually
directly serialize the file to the socket, and never load the file into memory, if you use the above **[filename]**
argument, instead of loading the file into memory first. Which of course, means saving significant amounts of
resources for your P5 server.

### Binary MIME entities

You can override the Content-Transfer-Encoding of your MIME messages, which is useful for binary data. Below
is an example of creating a MIME message, with one binary attachment, transferred as a base64 encoded MIME entity.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  image:png
    Content-Transfer-Encoding:base64
    filename:/system42/apps/CMS/media/p5.png
```

The above lambda would result in something resembling the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: image/png
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=p5.png

iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAABkCAYAAABw4pVUAAAABmJLR0QA/wD/AP+gvaeTAAAA
CXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAB3RJTUUH4QUZBzIy1NXmlgAAGflJREFUeNrtXWmYXGWV
[ ... snipped away ...]
rpAnmP5EO3XgV70+R8ozZ5F3Zc4WB21VNXz92xBI/4erfNndgryqgD4h3C9DJHsByDwrLSFm
rE6ChAnCHc4SsvP81Cheo1ggQwiqvybkbifvq4ZDcZmH3iUfug+7tuDim6si6/8BAk2DFgFq
oVgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=
"
```

You can also use "binary", and all other Content-Transfer-Encoding values supported by the MIME standard.

### The Multipart type dissected

A multipart MIME type is special, since it can contain multiple children MIME entities, in addition to a
**[preamble]** and an **[epilogue]**. To create a basic multipart, with two children MIME entities, having
a preamble and an epilogue, could be done like this.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed
    preamble:This is the preamble
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 1
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 2
    epilogue:This is the epilogue
```

The above would result in the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""=-iwCOwy10ijdRf3xIkKmXfg==""

This is the preamble
--=-iwCOwy10ijdRf3xIkKmXfg==
Content-Type: text/plain

Foo bar 1
--=-iwCOwy10ijdRf3xIkKmXfg==
Content-Type: text/plain

Foo bar 2
--=-iwCOwy10ijdRf3xIkKmXfg==--
This is the epilogue
"
```

### Encrypting and signing your MIME messages

If you wanted to encrypt your MIME message, this could easily be accomplished, by simply adding an **[encrypt]**
child node to it, containing the list of recipients, such as the following illustrates.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed
    encrypt
      email:thomas@gaiasoul.com
      // OR alternatively use the "fingerprint" of the certificate
      fingerprint:xxxx-some-PGP-certificate-fingerprint
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 1
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 2
```

Internally, the cryptography features of P5, uses GnuPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) to retrieve certificates and private
keys used in cryptography and signing of messages. You don't need to install GnuPG though, since MimeKit will
automatically create the PGP files necessary to store your PGP keypairs.

You would also (obviously) have to have the certificate used for encryption installed into your GnuPG database.
The above lambda, will throw an exception, simply because it won't find the public PGP key needed to encrypt
your message (assuming you don't have a public key for "thomas@gaiasoul.com").

Signing a multipart, with a private PGP key, is just as simple. Except, this time you would have to declare
which _private key_ to use. Which requires you to also supply a **[password]** node, beneath your
**[email]/[fingerprint]** argument, to have the GnuPG database release your private key. This is because internally,
your private PGP keys are stored symmetrically encrypted using AES encryption, with your password being the
encryption key.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed

    // Notice, this time we only sign the multipart
    sign
      email:thomas@gaiasoul.com
        password:Your-GnuPG-password
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 1
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 2
```

You can of course, _both_ sign and encrypt a MIME entity, supplying both an **[encrypt]** argument,
in addition to a **[sign]** argument.

Notice, _do not_ mark your encrypted/signed multiparts explicitly as "multipart:encrypted" or "multipart:signed",
since the encryption/signing process automatically wraps your entire message into an additional wrapper
"multipart:encrypted/signed" MIME entity. To see this in action, run the following code through Hypereval,
and see how your single "text:plain" entity, is wrapped inside an outer "multipart/signed" entity.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  text:plain
    sign
      email:YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL@gmail.com
        password:Your-GnuPG-password
    content:Foo bar 1
```

The above results in something resembling the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.create
  result:@"Content-Type: multipart/signed; boundary=""=-+2ZNhGoLEPVT/UQIzXf0PA=="";
    protocol=""application/pgp-signature""; micalg=pgp-sha256

--=-+2ZNhGoLEPVT/UQIzXf0PA==
Content-Type: text/plain

Foo bar 1
--=-+2ZNhGoLEPVT/UQIzXf0PA==
Content-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=signature.pgp
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=signature.pgp
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: BCPG C# v1.8.1.0

owJ4nAGeAGH/iJwEAQEIAAYFAllBBcsACgkQp+gOGJZNs4GcNQP+KxdJKpUXHb6v
smR86C+chDzrRqLcKI5O44xL44c3o74SBF3K1mUP2Cupf4UG12SmgzCh45lGxrzc

m8xshsVW8KnvhdpLBp0wmNIqg0d3COrorkbT
=7LsO
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

--=-+2ZNhGoLEPVT/UQIzXf0PA==--
"
```

Notice how your single text entity is wrapped inside a "multipart/signed" entity above. This is necessary to
make sure we also attach the actual signature of your MIME message.

### Parsing MIME messages

Parsing MIME messages is, if possible, even more easy than creating them. Simply use the **[p5.mime.parse]**
Active Event. In the example below, we are first creating a MIME message, for then to parse it.

```hyperlambda
// Creating a MIME message
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 1
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 2

// Parsing your MIME message
p5.mime.parse:x:/@p5.mime.create/*/result?value
```

When you parse a MIME message, you can supply a lot of optional arguments. The most important ones being.

* __[attachment-folder]__ - A folder on disc where you want to store attachments
* __[decrypt]__ - One or more decryption emails/fingerprints, with passwords, to decrypt encrypted emails

The **[attachment-folder]** argument above, allows you to specify an explicit folder, where you want to store
attachments. If you do, then the attachments from your MIME message will not be loaded into memory, but rather
saved directly to disc, and its path will be returned. This will return a **[filename]** argument for you,
in addition to a random **[prefix]** and a **[folder]**, created to make sure the file has a unique filename
on disc. This **[filename]** argument, will in combination with its **[prefix]** child argument, and **[folder]**
argument be, the path to where the file physically exists on disc. Of course the **[folder]** argument returned,
will be the same value as your **[attachment-folder]** input argument, and is simply returned for convenience
purposes.

The **[decrypt]** argument, is a collection of **[email]**/**[fingerprint]** values, each requiring a **[password]**
child, for private PGP keys to use while decrypting your emails. If you don't supply this, and you are trying
to parse an encrypted MIME message - Then you will get the raw encrypted text back, and not the plain text.

An example of using both of the above constructs can be found beneath.

```hyperlambda
// Creating an encrypted MIME message, with one attachment
p5.mime.create
  multipart:mixed
    encrypt
      email:YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL@gmail.com
    text:plain
      content:Foo bar 1
    text:X-Hyperlambda
      filename:/application-startup.hl

// Parsing your MIME message, supplying an attachment folder, and decryption key
p5.mime.parse:x:/@p5.mime.create/*/result?value
  attachment-folder:~/temp/
  decrypt
    email:YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL@gmail.com
      password:Your-GnuPG-password
```

The return value from the above **[p5.mime.parse]** invocation, will resemble the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.mime.parse
  multipart:encrypted
    decryption-key:YOUR_GMAIL_EMAIL@gmail.com
    multipart:mixed
      text:plain
        content:Foo bar 1
      text:X-Hyperlambda
        Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=application-startup.hl
        filename:application-startup.hl
          prefix:e8b4ea8eddb94c7ea9caffad6a4982b6-
          folder:/users/root/temp/
```

### Sending an encrypted and signed email

If you are using p5.mime in combination with p5.mail, you can use the following code to send an encrypted and signed
email. Please change the settings to your settings, and the private/public PGP keypair to something existing in
your own GnuPG database.

```hyperlambda
p5.smtp.send
  server:smtp.gmail.com
  port:465
  ssl:true
  username:YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com
  password:YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD
  envelope
    Subject:Hello from Phosphorus Five
    Sender
      Thomas Hansen:YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com
    To
      Thomas Hansen:SOMEBODY@SOMEWHERE.COM
    body
      multipart:mixed
        encrypt
          email:SOMEBODY@SOMEWHERE.COM
        sign
          email:YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com
            password:YOUR_GNUPG_PASSWORD
        text:plain
          content:Hello there, this is Phosphorus Five sending you an ENCRYPTED email.
```

### Fetching encrypted and signed MIME emails

If you are using p5.mime in combination with p5.mail, you can retrieve emails, decrypting them in the process,
with the following code.

```hyperlambda
p5.pop3.get
  server:pop.gmail.com
  port:995
  ssl:true
  username:YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com
  password:YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD
  decrypt
    email:YOUR_GMAIL_USERNAME@gmail.com
      password:YOUR_GNUPG_PASSWORD
```

Notice, we are using GMail in these examples, assuming you have a GMail account. You can of course use any
POP3/SMTP servers you wish, including the ones from your ISP, or servers you have set up for yourselves.

You can also supply an **[attachment-folder]** when fetching emails from your POP3 server, which will be
passed into the MIME parser automatically for you, and never load up attachments into memory - Which will
conserve a significant amount of resources on your server, for big attachments fetched from your POP3 server.

### Additional PGP related Active Events

There are also many other PGP related Active Events in p5.mime. Below is an exhaustive list.

* __[p5.crypto.create-pgp-keypair]__ - Creates a PGP keypair, and installs into your GnuPG database
* __[p5.crypto.list-private-keys]__ - List all private keys from GnuPG
* __[p5.crypto.list-public-keys]__ - List all public keys from GnuPG
* __[p5.crypto.get-key-details]__ - Returns the details for a PGP key
* __[p5.crypto.get-public-key]__ - Returns one or more public PGP keys
* __[p5.crypto.get-private-key]__ - Returns one or more private PGP keys
* __[p5.crypto.delete-private-key]__ - Delets a private PGP key
* __[p5.crypto.delete-public-key]__ - Delets a public PGP key
* __[p5.crypto.import-public-pgp-key]__ - Imports a public PGP key
* __[p5.crypto.import-private-pgp-key]__ - Imports a private PGP key
* __[.p5.mime.parse-native]__ - C# special Active Event for hooking into library for C# developers
* __[.p5.mime.create-native]__ - C# special Active Event for hooking into library for C# developers
* __[.p5.mime.serialize-to-stream]__ - Plugin Active Event for other C# components, such as e.g. the p5.http plugin

The last 3 Active Events are only for extension developers, who wants to use MIME natively in their own components,
and hence beyond the scope of this documentation. To see example usage of them though, feel free to check out for
instance the code of p5.mail or p5.http that consumes these events internally.

The first 10 Active Events in the above list, allows you to manage your GnuPG database, by creating new keys,
and modifying existing keys. Below is the documentation for them.

### [p5.crypto.create-pgp-keypair]

This event creates a private/public keypair for you, and installs it into your GnuPG database. To use it,
you could use something like the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.create-pgp-keypair

  // Mandatory arguments
  identity:foo@bar.com
  password:Your-GnuPG-Password

  // Optional arguments
  expires:date:"2020-06-14T10:51:59.018"
  strength:1024
  public-exponent:long:65537
  certainty:5
  seed:xyzqwerty124233456&$%
```

The above will create a PGP keypair for you, with the identity of "foo@bar.com", and the password of
"Your-GnuPG-Password", and install it into your GnuPG database. The rest of the arguments are optional,
with "sane defaults". One detail though, is that you can explicitly add to the seeding
of the random number generator by adding a **[seed]** argument - Which is probably wise, to make sure your
random numbers used to generate the keypair is less predictable. The last point of course, makes your
keypair much more difficult to predict. Preferably this should be some user supplied string, of a certain
length, for every time you create a keypair. Notice that the default seed is by default relatively unique,
with a very high entropy - But further adding to it, makes it even less predictable, and hence more secure.

Notice, if you use 4096 bit strength, or more - Then creating your key might take several minutes!

### [p5.crypto.list-private-keys] and [p5.crypto.list-public-keys]

These two Active Events simply lists your private and public PGP keys from your GnuPG database. Below is
an example of usage.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.list-private-keys
p5.crypto.list-public-keys
```

The above will result in something like the following.

```
p5.crypto.list-private-keys
  3a043739292f87e371116352a7e80e18964db381
  883c57f331661a58b2af5aa8a9ea8f251c05c160
  7fa6f6f56a37840bb4c5a820ee1646290fa70f72
  aabea2c7ecf44174f918e569968463c52ad8d65f
p5.crypto.list-public-keys
  3a043739292f87e371116352a7e80e18964db381
  883c57f331661a58b2af5aa8a9ea8f251c05c160
  7fa6f6f56a37840bb4c5a820ee1646290fa70f72
  aabea2c7ecf44174f918e569968463c52ad8d65f
```

Notice that what you get back from these Active Events, are the fingerprints of your keys. Both of these
Active Events takes an optional filter, for fingerprints you wish to look for. E.g., assuming you have
a private key with the specified fingerprint, you could use something like the following.

```hyperlambda
_fingerprints
  3a043739292f87e371116352a7e80e18964db381
  883c57f331661a58b2af5aa8a9ea8f251c05c160
p5.crypto.list-public-keys:x:/-/*?name
```

You can also supply one or more identities to look for as a filter condition. Example is given below.

```hyperlambda
// Looking for a specific identity
p5.crypto.list-private-keys:phosphorusfive@gmail.com

// Or listing all gmail.com keys
p5.crypto.list-private-keys:@gmail.com
```

### [p5.crypto.get-key-details]

This Active Event will return the details of one or more keys. Below is an example.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.get-key-details:phosphorusfive@gmail.com
```

The above code will return something like the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.get-key-details
  3a043739292f87e371116352a7e80e18964db381
    id:964DB381
    algorithm:RsaGeneral
    strength:int:1024
    creation-time:date:"2017-06-01T17:22:32"
    is-encryption-key:bool:true
    is-master-key:bool:true
    is-revoked:bool:false
    version:int:4
    expires:date:"2020-06-01T17:22:31"
    user-ids
      :Thomas Hansen <phosphorusfive@gmail.com>
    signed-by
      964DB381:date:"2017-06-01T17:22:32"
```

This event can also return multiple results. For instance, to return all details from all GMail keys, can be
done with something resembling the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.get-key-details:@gmail.com
```

### [p5.crypto.get-public-key] and [p5.crypto.get-private-key]

These two Active Events will return the actual key content. Usage can be found below.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.get-public-key:phosphorusfive@gmail.com
p5.crypto.get-private-key:phosphorusfive@gmail.com
```

Which will result in something like the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.get-public-key
  3a043739292f87e371116352a7e80e18964db381:@"-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Notice, my private key above, is (obviously) a bogus testing key, and not my real actual PGP key.

This allows you to export your private and public keys, to create backups or something out of them.
Realize though that private keys, will be exported in "armored format", which means you will still need the
password to the key, to retrieve its actual content.

### [p5.crypto.delete-private-key] and [p5.crypto.delete-public-key]

These Active Events simply deletes the specified public or private key(s). For these Active events you must
supply the fingerprint, and none of them will tolerate an identity, such as an email address, etc.
This is to make sure you actually delete the right key, and not accidentally delete a private key,
which is still in use.

### [p5.crypto.import-public-pgp-key] and [p5.crypto.import-private-pgp-key]

These Active Events allows you to import one or more private and/or public key(s). Below we are importing
a public key, with the identity of "foo@bar.com".

```hyperlambda

Check out your GnuPG database afterwards, by doing for instance something like the following.

```hyperlambda
p5.crypto.get-key-details:foo@bar.com
```

Notice, if none of these last parts makes any sense for you at all - I encourage you to go to e.g. YouTube and
do a search for e.g. "GnuPG" or "PGP", "Public key cryptography", etc, to understand how PGP and GnuPG works.
These last Active Events are simply thin wrappers around your existing GnuPG database, which holds your Open
PGP keys.

### Technical details

The MIME parser in P5 is internally using [MimeKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit), and MimeKit
internally again is using [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) for its cryptography features.
Especially the MIME parts of P5 is therefor probably orders of magnitudes faster than most other MIME
parser out there.
