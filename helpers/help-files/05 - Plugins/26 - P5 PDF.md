This folder contains the Active Events necessary to create PDF files from HTML. There is one Active Event in
this project, that allows you to create a PDF document from an HTML snippet. Its name is **[html2pdf]**. Below
is an example of using it.

```hyperlambda
_html:@"<h2>Hello, World</h2>
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text. And this is <em>italics</em>.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph!</p>"
html2pdf:~/temp/my-pdf-files.pdf
  src:x:/@_html?value
```

### CSS support

Optionally, you can supply one or more **[css-file]** arguments to this Active Event, which will use the CSS files
when creating the PDF.

### License

Notice, although P5 is released under the terms of GPL, it utilises iTextSharp, which is released under the terms of
the Affero GPL license. This implies that even if you purchase a proprietary license of P5, you'll still
(unfortunately) need to link to the source code of p5.pdf. However, due to the modularised properties of P5,
this should have no consequences for the rest of your code.
