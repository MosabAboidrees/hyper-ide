## Dynamically creating Active Events in P5

In Phosphorus Five, you can create static Active Events in C#, by adding the `ActiveEvent` attribute to your
C# methods. You can also use any lambda object as an _"anonymous function"_. In addition, you can also
easily execute Hyperlambda files, the same way you would invoke a function or method, passing in arguments,
and returning values, just like you would with a normal function. The latter could be accomplished using
e.g. **[micro.evaluate.file]**, if you have [Micro](https://github.com/polterguy/micro) installed as a module.
Micro is installed by default in Phosphorus Five.

However, there is also the possibility of dynamically creating globally accessible Active Events,
through the **[create-event]** Active Event. This Active Event, allows you to modify the underlaying
Active Event dictionary directly, by either modifying existing, adding new, or deleting existing entries
within it. Almost like you would do with any other dictionary/hash-table object. Imagine the following code.

```hyperlambda
create-event:foo
  eval-x:x:/+
  return:Hello there {0}
    :x:/../*/_arg?value
foo:Thomas
```

When executed, the **[foo]** invocation above, will look like this.

```hyperlambda
/* ... other code ... */
foo:Hello there Thomas
```

Notice the _"Hello there Thomas"_ value of the **[foo]** node above. This was the return value,
from the Active Event **[foo]** we created.

When you create a dynamic Active Event, this event will be accessible for any lambda object in your
application pool, for the life span of your application pool. This means that if something resets
your server, somehow, forcing the web-server application pool process to restart, for some reasons
(reboot of server or recycling your app pool for instance), you need to re-create your dynamic
Active Events, if you wish for them to still be acccessible.

This dynamic trait of P5, allows you to dynamically create Active Events, during runtime of your
application, without requiring a recompilation or restart of your web server process. It also
allows you to install new apps in your system, without requiring a reboot of the web-server
process, etc.

Besides from that they're globally accessible, there is no real difference between a normal
lambda object, and a dynamically created Active Event - They behave exactly the same way in all
regards. When you invoke a dynamic Active Event, you are given a _"shallow copy"_ of your
event's lambda, which is evaluated, as if it was a normal lambda object. Making it possible
to pass in arguments, and return nodes and values, as if it was a normal lambda object,
evaluated using the **[eval]** Active Event.

### Deleting events

The **[delete-event]** Active Event, allows you to completely delete a dynamic Active Event.
You can either provide an expression, leading to multiple names, or a constant deleting only one event.

However, if you invoke **[create-event]** with no lambda object as its children, you will also
delete any existing events with the given name. The **[delete-event]** allows you to delete
multiple events at the same time though, which the **[create-event]**, without a lambda object
does _not_. Besides, it is probably better to be more clear in your vocabulary, and explicitly
use the Active Event **[delete-event]**, to communicate your intent more precisely.

### Stateful Active Events

Sometimes, it might be necessary to create a _"stateful"_ Active Event. Meaning, an Active Event,
that somehow is able to remember state, across multiple invocations. The way you'd do this in
most other OOP programming languages, is by creating an instance data field, or something similar,
and keep the object reference alive. However, in Phosphorus Five, no such thing exists. In fact,
Hyperlambda doesn't even have OO any mechanism at all.

However, if you have a node, who's value is of type node, then its value will actually be
remembered across multiple invocations of your event. That's why we said _"shallow copy"_ above.
When you invoke an Active Event, then you get a copy of its lambda to evaluate. However, since
all values are copied by reference, and not cloned, this means that each invocation will act
upon the same value object. For the .Net types, this has no consequence, since they're for the
most parts immutable. However, for the Node class, which is the underlaying structure of a lambda
object, this has side effects, which you can benefit from, to create _"stateful events"_.

Simply because the copy of the Active Event you are evaluating, will have a shallow copy of its
values, allowing you to share node references, inside of values of Active Events, across multiple
invocations to the same event. Consider this Active Event.

```hyperlambda
create-event:foo
  _static:node:"count:int:0"
  set:x:/../*/_static/#?value
    +:x:/../*/_static/#?value
      _:int:1
  eval-x:x:/+
  return:Lambda invocation count was; {0}
    :x:/../*/_static/#?value
foo
foo
foo
```

If you now evaluate the following Hyperlambda, you will clearly see your **[foo]** Active Event
is able to remember its invocation count, across multiple invocations. This is because the
`_static:node:"count:int:0"` node's value will be shared for all invocations to your event.

Try to run this code.

```hyperlambda
foo
foo
foo
```

Notice, this feature, might require you to synchronize access to the lambda that is accessing
your nodes, to avoid race-conditions and similar. This is because
the value of our **[\_static]** node above, is actually a shared resource. Synchronizing acccess
to the **[\_static]** node above, can easily be done by wrapping your access to it in a **[lock]**
lambda block, which is documented in the p5.threading project. An example is given below.

```hyperlambda
create-event:foo
  _static:node:"count:int:0"
  lock:lock.foo
    set:x:/../*/_static/#?value
      +:x:/../*/_static/#?value
        _:int:1
    eval-x:x:/+
    return:Lambda invocation count was; {0}
      :x:/../*/_static/#?value
```

For the record, the above _"Ninja Trick"_, is something you should be careful with, since stateful
Active Events, in most cases, is _not_ considered good practice. Besides, synchronizing access to
shared resources, is often quite resource expensive, in terms of scalability. However, for those
rare occassions, where it makes sense, it _really_ make sense. A good example is for instance
caching. Hint, if you re-create the above **[foo]** Active Event, you will reset the hit count.

### Listing all Active Events in your system

If you wish to see a list of all Active events in your system, this can easily be done using
the **[vocabulary]** Active Event.

```hyperlambda
vocabulary
```

After evaluating the above code, you will get a list of nodes, where the name of the node says
either _"static"_ or _"dynamic"_, where _"dynamic"_ are your dynamically created Active Events,
and vice versa. If you wish to exclude all _"static"_ Active Events, this can easily be done
with an additional **[set]** invocation, filtering away nodes with the name of _"static"_,
like the following code illustrates.

```hyperlambda
vocabulary
set:x:/-/*/static
```

The **[vocabulary]** event has a protected alias, called **[.vocabulary]** (of course), which
will also return all protected events, but (of course) must be raised from C#. Also the
**[create-event]** and **[delete-event]** have similar protected alias overrides. **[vocabulary]**
optionally takes a filter condition. Try it out with the following code.

```hyperlambda
// Listing everything containing the text "micro."
vocabulary:~micro.

// Checks it "micro.widgets.modal" is in your system
vocabulary:micro.widgets.modal
```

The difference between the two above invocations is the `~` parts. The tilde checks for
_"contains the string in its name"_, while without a tilde at the start of your filter,
it expects an exact match. You can also supply an expression leading to multiple filters
if you wish.

```hyperlambda
.events
  micro.widgets.modal
  micro.widgets.tree
  micro.widgets.tab
  non-existing

  // "Like" comparison.
  ~micro.page.

// Uses the above [.events] names' as its filter.
vocabulary:x:/-/*?name
```
