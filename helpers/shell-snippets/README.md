# Template shell snippets

This folder contains _"template shell snippets"_, which you can choose from when opening up a teminal execution window.
Such snippets can contain things you often tend to do on a _"folder level"_, such as GIT commands, cache cleaning, etc.

When you open up a _"terminal window"_ for a folder, you can choose from all these template snippets. Feel free to create 
your own template snippets here.
