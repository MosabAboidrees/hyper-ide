# Template shell snippets

This folder contains _"template shell snippets"_, which you can choose from when opening up a teminal execution window.
Such snippets can contain things you often tend to do on a _"folder level"_, such as GIT commands, cache cleaning, etc.

When you open up a _"terminal window"_ for a folder, you can choose from all these template snippets. Feel free to create 
your own template snippets here.

Common things you often tend to do, should probably be here, such as GIT integration, etc, which there actually exist 
template files for in the folder.
