 * Creates our execute JavaScript file plugin toolbar button.

 * This button is only visible if the active file is a JavaScript file.
 *
 * __Notice__, this is a pretty useful plugin, since the CodeMirror's autocomplete object
 * is populated according to the context of the page. So if you need to use JavaScript AutoComplete
 * features, according to the file you're editing, you would probably want to evaluate its JavaScript
 * as you're editing your file. This plugin allows you to do just that.
