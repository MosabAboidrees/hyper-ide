Phosphorus Five is using a CSS framework called _"Micro"_. This is a _"microscopic"_ alternative to
Bootstrap CSS, which easily allows you to skin it, according to your own needs. Hyper IDE contains a
_"wizard"_ skin generator, which you can access if you select the _"/modules/micro/media/skins/"_
folder. Select this folder, and click the _"star"_ button in your toolbar - At which point your screen
should resemble the following.

The skinning wizard is fairly self explaining, and will allow you to manually edit its skin file after
you have gone through it - At which point you can add up custom selectors, load fonts, etc, as you see fit.
The above properties are simply all CSS variables that Micro is using, allowing you to override these
from the core CSS file. The _"Preview"_ tab view will allow you to see how your variables will look like
before you generate your skin file. When you click _"Generate"_, a new CSS file will be created, and
opened for you in Hyper IDE, such that you can manually edit it if you want to.

Since Phosphorus Five allows you to select a skin according to all files that it finds within the
_"/modules/micro/media/skins/"_ folder, you can immediately start using your new skin, by choosing
it from your Desktop module's settings.

**Notice**, some basic CSS understanding is beneficial if you want to create your own skin.
